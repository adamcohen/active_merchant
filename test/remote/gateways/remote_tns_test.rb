  # Pay (also known as Purchase) â€” requires a single transaction to
  # authorize the payment and transfer funds from the cardholder's
  # account to your account. This mode effectively completes the
  # Authorize and Capture operations at the same time. Pay is the most
  # common type of payment model used by merchants to accept
  # payments. Pay model is used when the merchant is allowed to bill the
  # cardholder's account immediately, for example when providing
  # services or goods on the spot.
